## About
This project was an attempt to create a flat/2D Minecraft clone using CodeHS' API, as well as highlight missing features/issues with the API in hopes that this will be resolved in the future. As of now, you can navigate through a simple menu system, change your skin, and load a flat world where you can place and delete blocks. 
<br>

Due to the issues referenced above, development of this project has ceased.
